Fire Department Calls for Service:

https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Fire-Department-Calls-for-Service/nuek-vuh3

Fire Calls-For-Service includes all fire units responses to calls. Each record includes the call number, incident number, address, unit identifier, call type, and disposition. All relevant time intervals are also included. Because this dataset is based on responses, and since most calls involved multiple units, there are multiple records for each call number. Addresses are associated with a block number, intersection or call box, not a specific address.



Fire Incidents:

https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Fire-Incidents/wr8u-xric

Fire Incidents includes a summary of each (non-medical) incident to which the SF Fire Department responded. Each incident record includes the call number, incident number, address, number and type of each unit responding, call type (as determined by dispatch), prime situation (field observation), actions taken, and property loss.
